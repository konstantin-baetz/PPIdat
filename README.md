# PPIdat
A machine-readable version of the Peddling Peril Index.

## Purpose
This repo provides researchers with a machine-readable version of the PPI. This index was developed by the Institute for Science and International Security in order to measure country specififc strategic trade controls.

More information can be found [here](https://isis-online.org/ppi/).

## Structure
At this time, the data includes two years (2017 and 2019) and one index as well as five sub-indices.

These are available in the /PPI_full.csv file. The original source of this data are the .pdf files found in the /source/ directory. For further information, see Codebook.md.

## Sources

The original data is availabe [here](https://isis-online.org/ppi/detail/peddling-peril-index-ppi-2017/) for 2017 and [here](https://isis-online.org/ppi/detail/peddling-peril-index-for-2019/) for 2019.

### Note:
The data was collected by the Institute for Science and International Security. It does not belong to me, I have simply transcribed it from publicy available pdf files. I am not in any way affilated with the Institute for Science and International Security.
