# PPIdat
A machine-readable version of the Peddling Peril Index

## Purpose
This repo provides researchers with a machine-readable version of the PPI. This index was developed by the Institute for Science and International Security in order to measure country specififc strategic trade controls.

More information can be found [here](https://isis-online.org/ppi/)

## Structure
At this time, the data includes two years (2017 and 2019) and one index as well as five sub-indices.

These are available as .csv files.

### Note:
The data was collected by the Institute for Science and International Security. It does not belong to me, I have simply transcribed it from publicy available pdf files.
